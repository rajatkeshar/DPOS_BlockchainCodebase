# Saffron

Saffron system is a decentralized application platform, which is designed to lower the threshold for developers, such as using JavaScript as develop language, supporting relational database to save transaction data, and making DAPP development be similar with traditional Web application. It is sure that these characteristics are very attractive to developers and SMEs. The ecosystem of the whole platform cannot be improved until developers make a huge progress on productivity. Also, Saffron platform is designed to be open for various fields, not limited to some particular parts such as finance, file storage, or copyright proof. It provides underlying and abstract API which can be combined freely to create different types of applications. In consensus mechanism, Saffron inherits and enhances DPOS algorithm, by which the possibility of forks and risk of duplicate payments would be significantly reduced. Furthermore, Saffron sidechain mode not only can mitigate the pressure of blockchain expansion, but also make DAPP more flexible and personal. Saffron system, as a proactive, low-cost and full stack solution, will surely be a next generation incubator of decentralized applications.
